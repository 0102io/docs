# Actuator Panels

TappyTap is currently available in two forms: the Swatch and the Palm. Both are intended as development tools, with the Swatch being general purpose (i.e. could be worn anywhere on your body or on another interactive surface) and the Palm being application specific (i.e. worn on your hand).

## Swatch

The Swatch is a generic sheet. It has 18x24 tappers.

## Palm

The Palm is a sheet of TappyTap fabric sized for the palm of your hand (if your hand is the same size as ours).

## Controller

The Controller is a Bluetooth enabled device for controlling the tappers in the fabric systems.

## Battery PCB

The Battery PCB is a single cell LiPo battery protection circuit + monitor.

## Battery Charger

The Battery Charger can charge 2 battery packs at a time, each at 370mA peak current.
